# GraphQL Example

A basic example of a GraphQL implementation with some information and opinion on it and maybe some comparison with other related solutions. Also, probably a spike into some popular tooling and community packages. I don't know. Just a strong starting point for anyone who is mostly new to it.

The GraphQL landing page can be found [here](https://graphql.org/).

## What is GraphQL?
### [Wikipedia - GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL)

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a query runtime engine.

GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API.

### [Redhat - What is GraphQL?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-graphql#:~:text=and%20open%20source-,Overview,flexible%2C%20and%20developer%2Dfriendly.)

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. 

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.

### [GraphQL - Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/#:~:text=GraphQL%20is%20a%20query%20language,your%20existing%20code%20and%20data.)

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.

 GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

GraphQL is an open source query language that describes how a client should request information through an API. 

In a broad sense, GraphQL is a syntax developers can use to ask for specific data and return that data from multiple sources.

### [Ritza - GraphQL vs. SQL](https://ritza.co/articles/graphql-vs-rest-vs-sql-vs-grpc-vs-odata-vs-mongodb/#:~:text=GraphQL%20is%20a%20flexible%20query,built%20on%20a%20NoSQL%20database.)

GraphQL is a flexible query language that uses a type system to efficiently return data with dynamic queries.

SQL(structured query language) is an older, more adopted language standard used specifically for tabular/relational database systems.

Consider GraphQL if you want your API to be built on a NoSQL database.
